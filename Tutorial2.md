# Tutorial 2: Hands-on With Docker

## Objective

This tutorial and hands-on session aims to enable you to use Docker as an integral part of the development process for a Node.js web application. The focus is on providing the skills necessary to compile, run, and manage code with Docker containers, highlighting Docker's role as a versatile development toolbox that enhances workflow consistency and efficiency.

## Introduction

### Overview of Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

Docker allows you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

### Overview of Node.js

Node.js is a powerful, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that enables developers to execute JavaScript code server-side. Renowned for its efficiency and scalability, Node.js operates on the V8 engine, allowing for high-speed execution of JavaScript outside the web browser.

It adopts an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it particularly well-suited for building scalable network applications like web servers, real-time communication systems, and API services.

Node.js comes with npm, a vast package manager, enriching its ecosystem with a wide array of libraries and tools. This cross-platform environment is favored for its ability to handle concurrent requests efficiently, making it a popular choice for modern web development, especially in applications requiring real-time capabilities.

With a robust community, Node.js has become a staple in the technology stacks of many companies and developers worldwide.

## Getting Ready

Ensure that you have Docker set up and running in your system.

Here are some common terminologies used in Docker that you should familiarise yourselves with:

| Term             | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Docker Daemon    | Listens to Docker API requests. Manages Docker objects - images, containers, networks and volumes. It can also communicate with other daemons.                          |
| Docker Image     | Read-only templates used to create Docker containers. You can create your own image or use pre-existing ones.                                                           |
| Docker Container | A runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.                                                  |
| Docker Registry  | A repository for Docker images. Docker Hub is the default registry. Using `docker pull` or `docker run` commands uses the required images from the configured registry. |
| Docker Client    | The primary way users interact with Docker. It sends commands to the Docker Daemon. It can communicate with >1 daemon.                                                  |
| Docker Desktop   | A GUI tool that includes the Docker Daemon, Client, Docker Compose, Content Trust, Kubernetes, etc.                                                                     |
| Docker Objects   | Images, containers, networks, volumes, plugins, etc.                                                                                                                    |

## Dockerfile

### What is a Dockerfile?

- A Dockerfile is a text document containing a set of instructions to build a Docker image.
- Docker images form the basis of containers, which are isolated environments running your application.

### Key Instructions

| Instruction  | Usage                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FROM         | Specifies the base image to start building your image. For example, `FROM ubuntu:18.04` starts with the Ubuntu 18.04 image.                                                       |
| RUN          | Executes a command and commits the results. Used for installing software packages, for example.                                                                                   |
| COPY and ADD | Both are used to copy files from the host filesystem to the container. `COPY` is straightforward, while `ADD` has some extra features like remote URL support and tar extraction. |
| CMD          | Provides a command and its default arguments that will be executed when the container starts. Only the last `CMD` instruction is effective.                                       |
| ENTRYPOINT   | Similar to `CMD`, but is meant to define the container's main executable and its arguments are appended to the entrypoint.                                                        |
| ENV          | Sets environment variables.                                                                                                                                                       |
| EXPOSE       | Indicates which ports the container listens on.                                                                                                                                   |
| WORKDIR      | Sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY`, and `ADD` instructions.                                                                                    |

### Basic Structure

- A Dockerfile comprises a set of instructions, like `FROM`, `RUN`, `COPY`, `ENTRYPOINT`, etc.
- Each instruction creates a layer in the Docker image.

### Sample Dockerfile

- File naming convention: `Dockerfile`

```
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:20-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install any dependencies
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source inside the Docker image
COPY . .

# Make port 3000 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run your app
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Best Practices

- Use specific versions of Node.js in your `FROM` statement.
- Minimize layer size: Group instructions like RUN to reduce the number of layers.
- Use `.dockerignore` to avoid copying unnecessary files into your Docker image.

## Docker Commands

## Node.js Application

### Getting Ready

- Download or Clone the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Jai2501/Tutorial2)
- Open a command line/terminal window and navigate into the source code folder (`Tutorial2/demo-app`).

### The Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is currently empty. The aim of this hands-on is to teach you how to write a Dockerfile.

1. As we are interested to build a Node.js Application using React, we need to have a runtime environment that has our desired version of Node.js installed. Thus, we would use the official Node image as a parent image to acheieve our objective.

Add the following line to the Dockerfile:

```
FROM node:20-alpine
```

2. Next, we specify the working directory in the container.

Add the following line to the Dockerfile:

```
WORKDIR /app
```

3. In the case of Node.js applications, we need to copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`) files as these include the relevant dependencies of our app. Node.js relies on these files to lookup and install the dependencies.

Add the following line to the Dockerfile:

```
COPY package*.json ./
```

4. After the files have been copied, the relevant dependencies have to be installed, and on using the command `npm install`, the required node modules (dependencies) are installed.

Add the following line to the Dockerfile:

```
RUN npm install
```

5. After all dependencies have been installed, we copy the entire source code directory into the working directory of the container and this includes all of the relevant code.

Add the following line to the Dockerfile:

```
COPY . .
```

6. Next, we want to be able to interact with our app and as React based apps by default start on port 3000, we expose that port. This allows the outside world to interact with the created container and our app using port 3000.

Add the following line to the Dockerfile:

```
EXPOSE 3000
```

7. Now that all is set up, we want to start our app. For starting React based apps, the command used is `npm start`, and hence that is what we add as a command next.

Add the following line to the Dockerfile:

```
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Finally, the created Dockerfile should look like this:

```
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Building the Image

Now that the Dockerfile is setup, we have a skeleton for the image of our app.

Using the `docker build` command, we will now create an image of our app.

1. Open a command line/terminal window and navigate to the downloaded/cloned repo, and then into the `demo-app` directory where the Dockerfile is located.

2. Run the following command:

```
docker build -t tic3001-demo-app .
```

- Above, the `-t` flag tags the create image with `tic3001-demo-app`.
- `.` refers to look for the Dockerfile in the Current Working Directory (CWD)

### Running the Container

With the Image ready, we can run our React app using Docker.

1. In the same command line/terminal window, run the following command:

```
docker run --name my-app -p 3000:3000 -d tic3001-demo-app
```

- Above, the flag `-p` allows to bind our systems port 3000 to the port 3000 of container.

- The flag `-d` allows to run the Docker Container in detached mode.

2. Open your browser of choice and go to http://localhost:3000/ to interact with the React App.

3. The running container can be stopped using the command:

```
docker stop my-app
```

### Binding the Current Working Directory

Binding the Current Working Directory with the Docker Container allows you to edit your code on your local system and see the changes in the app in real-time that is running on the Docker Container.

1. In the same command line/terminal window, run the following command:

macOS users:

```
docker run --name my-app -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app -d tic3001-demo-app
```

Windows Command Line users:

```
docker run --name my-app -p 3000:3000 -v %cd%:/app -d tic3001-demo-app
```

Windows Powershell users:

```
docker run --name my-app -p 3000:3000 -v ${PWD}:/app -d tic3001-demo-app
```

- The flag `-v` allows to mount the Current Working Directory as a volunme in the Docker Container.

2. Go to `src/App.js` and add the following code inside the `function App()`:

```
function toggleAnimation() {
  var logo = document.querySelector(".App-logo-clockwise");
  var isLogoRotatingClockwise = logo !== null;

  if (isLogoRotatingClockwise) {
    logo.classList.remove("App-logo-clockwise");
    logo.classList.add("App-logo-anti-clockwise");
  } else {
    logo = document.querySelector(".App-logo-anti-clockwise");

    logo.classList.remove("App-logo-anti-clockwise");
    logo.classList.add("App-logo-clockwise");
  }
}
```

3. In the same file, add the following code inside the `<header>` tag, right after the `<p>` tag

```
<button className="spin-btn" onClick={() => toggleAnimation()}>
  Toggle Spin Direction
</button>
```

4. Press `CTRL/CMD + S`

5. You should now be able to see a button that says "Toggle Spin Direction", which on clicking will change the spin direction of the React logo.

![Updated React Page text](finalReactPage.png)

6. The running container can be stopped using the command:

```
docker stop my-app
```

> Note: If you do not bind volumes, such changes can not be seen in real-time, and the containers have to be stopped and run again, making the process tedious. Please refer to the section on [Binding the Current Working Directory](#binding-the-current-working-directory)

### Exercise

1. Create a Dockerfile for demo-service based on the following inputs:

- Parent image is `node:20-alpine`
- Working directory as `/app`
- Service Port Number `3001`
- Command to run service: `npm start`

2. Build and Run the container.

3. Go to `http://localhost:3001/` and you should see the following output:

## Node.js Application

### The docker-compose.yml file

The docker-compose.yml file is created in the root of your project. This file defines how Docker containers should behave when ran together.

```
# Specify the version of the Docker Compose.
version: "3.9"

# Define the services and applications that make up your application.
services:
  demo-app:
    build: ./demo-app # Path to the directory containing the Dockerfile for building the demo-app image.
    ports:
      - 3000:3000 # Maps port 3000 on the host to port 3000 in the container, making the app accessible on the host.
    volumes:
      - ./demo-app:/app # Mounts the host directory './demo-app' to '/app' in the container.
      - /app/node_modules # Anonymous Volume
    networks:
      - demo-network # Connects the demo-app to the 'demo-network' network.

  demo-service:
    build: ./demo-service # Path to the directory containing the Dockerfile for the demo-service.
    ports:
      - 3001:3001 # Maps port 3001 on the host to port 3001 in the container.
    volumes:
      - ./demo-service:/app # Mounts the host directory './demo-service' to '/app' in the container.
      - /app/node_modules # Anonymous Volume
    networks:
      - demo-network # Connects the demo-service to the 'demo-network' network.

networks:
  demo-network: # Defines a network named 'demo-network'.
    driver: bridge # Uses the bridge driver for the network, which is the default and most common network type in Docker.
```

### Building the Images

Using the following command, all the services (and networks, volumes) are built, without requiring to invoke and run commands one by one:

```
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

- Above, the flag `--no-cache` forces docker to rebuild all images from scratch.

### Running the Containers

Using the following command, all the containers specified in the docker-compose file are ran:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

- Above, the flag `-d` runs all containers in detached mode.

### Exercise

1. Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and add demo-service as a `sevice` in the file.

2. Build and Run the containers using `docker-compose` commands.

## Conclusion

As we conclude this tutorial, it's clear that integrating Docker into the Node.js development process brings substantial benefits, streamlining and refining how we build, run, and manage applications. Key highlights include:

- **Resolving "Runs on My Machine" Dilemma**: Docker stands out in its ability to eliminate the all-too-common "runs on my machine" issue. By containerizing the Node.js environment, Docker ensures consistent behavior across different development and production settings, thereby promoting reliability and reducing environment-specific bugs.

- **Streamlined Dependency Management**: A major advantage of using Docker is the abstraction of dependency management. Containers come pre-packed with all necessary dependencies, obviating the need for individual installations. This not only simplifies the setup but also avoids conflicts arising from mismatched dependency versions.

- **Immediate Project Ramp-Up**: Docker's containerization allows developers to bypass the time-consuming setup process traditionally associated with development environments. With everything encapsulated in a container, starting a new project or joining an existing one becomes a quick and straightforward process.

- **Simplified Collaboration and Distribution**: Sharing a project is as simple as sharing its Dockerfile and docker-compose file. This ease of distribution ensures that team members can replicate the exact development environment effortlessly, paving the way for seamless collaboration and consistency across teams.
